# My First GitHub Repository

This is my first GitHub repo ðŸŽ‰  

I uploaded a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates some simple syntaxes in Jupyter, such as:

- Markdown cells  
- Headers  
- Lists  
- Tables  

The notebook is part of my practice for learning Jupyter and Data Science basics for IBM course .
